MixUp Text Manipulator
======================

MixUp uses an algorithm based on a list of paired word lists to change certain words in a given text. If the algorithm finds one of your words in a word list, it will randomly select a word from the list which is paired to the one in which your word is found. So, for example, the words for "good" are paired with the words for "bad", which could reslt in a sentence such as "I love peaches" to be transformed into "I abhor peaches". There are plenty of other weird and funny transformations in the algorithm, however, and I urge you to try out the program to see what kind of hilarity it is capable of producing.
